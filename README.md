## **Skills Gained**
1. **Network Diagnostics:** Analyzing network health and performance using tools like `ping` and `traceroute`.
2. **Secure Communication:** Establishing encrypted connections to remote systems via SSH.
3. **Key-Based Authentication:** Enhancing security by replacing password-based logins with SSH keys.
4. **System Administration:** Managing server configurations and understanding SSH services.
5. **Port Forwarding:** Securing data flows between local and remote systems.

## **Tools Used**
- **Ping:** For network diagnostics and connectivity testing.
- **PuTTY:** A versatile SSH client for Windows.
- **SSH (Linux):** Native command-line tool for secure server access.
- **Kali Linux & Ubuntu Server:** Virtual machines for practical labs.

## **Lab Topics**

### **Lab 12: Exploring Ping and Its Uses**
- **Objective:** Understand how to use the `ping` utility and its parameters to troubleshoot network connectivity.
- **Highlights:**
  - Measure packet loss, latency, and network performance.
  - Use options like `-c`, `-s`, and `-4` for controlled packet sending.
  - Perform stress tests with flood pings and analyze results.

### **Lab 13: SSH into a Server from a Windows Machine Using PuTTY**
- **Objective:** Learn to securely connect to a server from Windows using PuTTY.
- **Highlights:**
  - Setting up and configuring PuTTY.
  - Understanding SSH protocols and their applications.
  - Managing sessions for repeated connections.

### **Lab 14: SSH into a Server from a Linux Machine**
- **Objective:** Use Linux's built-in SSH capabilities to connect to remote servers.
- **Highlights:**
  - Establishing password-based and key-based SSH connections.
  - Regenerating SSH keys for secure communication.
  - Utilizing SSH tunneling for port forwarding and secure file transfers.
 
  - ## **Future Labs**
This repository is a work in progress, and I plan to include additional labs covering topics like:
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention.
- Secure File Transfers.
- Network Monitoring with Wireshark.
- Advanced Threat Analysis.
